# Iris Dataset Classification

## Project Overview
I practised machine learning concepts with this beginner Iris dataset from sklearn. This project classifies iris flowers into their species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project guided me through loading data, training models, evaluating accuracy, and making predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 150 samples across three iris species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

Features used:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Install required packages
